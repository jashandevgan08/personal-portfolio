Each card contains a project image, title, and description — ideal for portfolio or personal project displays.

## ✅ How to Use

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Replace placeholder images (`image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`) with your own.
3. Customize titles and descriptions for each project.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## 📱 Responsiveness

This layout is mobile-friendly. Project cards automatically adjust to fit smaller screens by using flexible widths and vertical stacking.

## ✨ Demo
